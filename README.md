# Projects and Examples

## Environment Setup

1. Clone this repo
2. Checkout a new branch like weatherly, functions_example, logic_statement_example, etc.
3. Create a folder with the same name as the branch in the repo. Your repo structure should look like itip-android/weatherly
4. Put your code in there!

## Android

All Android projects should be made as Android Studio Projects.

Please use Android KitKit 4.4.2 as the project's mininum support Android version.

## Philosophy

When building an example or project, you should stick to simplicity and non-complex concepts. Students who are just learning to program will working back through these projects guided by an instructor. They’ll have help, but your architecture should not be too complex. Your implementation should also not include advanced topics.

Do not build your projects and examples as the "best" solution. Build your projects to be the most readable and easy-to-follow solutions for a beginner. 

## Creativity

The key to building great projects and examples is creativity and conceptual simplicity. 

As we all know, tip calculators are boring and don’t provide real use. Think about an example or project you can actually see yourself relating to and using. 

Projects and examples people can relate to make learning and using the concepts easier and stick.

## Comments

As you’re working through your task, you should make sure you’re commenting every complex line of code. As an instructor is guiding students through your project, those comments will allow the instructor to know how you built and why you chose that implementation.

If you’re thinking about whether something should be commented or not, it should probably be commented.

## Submission and Review

Once you’ve completed your task (or get to a stopping point with the larger tasks), submit via a pull request to Github. 

Review will be done on Github using the Issue Tracker.
